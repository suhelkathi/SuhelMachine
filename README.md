## ‚ö†Ô∏è Opening in VMware 16 ‚Äì Important Fix

If you are using **VMware Workstation 16** or **VMware Player 16**, you must **downgrade the VM's virtual hardware version manually**:

1. Open the VM folder after extracting the `.zip`.
2. Locate the file with the extension: `.vmx` (e.g., `Ubuntu 64-bit (2).vmx`).
3. Open it in any text editor (like Notepad).
4. Find this line (or similar):

virtualHW.version = "20"

markdown
Copy
Edit

5. Change `"20"` to `"16"`:

virtualHW.version = "16"

markdown
Copy
Edit

6. Save and close the file.
7. Now open the VM in VMware Workstation 16.

‚úÖ Done! The VM should now be compatible.
